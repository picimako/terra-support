<h4>0.4.0</h4>
<b>New</b>
<ul>
    <li>Added partial support for TypeScript (.ts) spec files.</li>
    <li>Added inspection to report Terra.describeViewports blocks with the same set of viewport values within the same file.</li>
    <li>Added gutter icons / line markers for screenshot validation calls in wdio spec files. Image references are added only
        to default-screenshot icons because non-default ones are referenced via the Terra calls' name parameters.</li>
    <li>Added the **Navigate to Usage** action to the wdio tool window, so that users can jump to the code section
        where the screenshot's validation happens.</li>
</ul>
