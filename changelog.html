<h4>0.4.1</h4>
<b>Enhancement</b>
<ul>
    <li>Extended the screenshot name resolution logic with test id handling based on <a href="https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit-boneyard/blob/main/config/wdio/visualRegressionConf.js">terra-toolkit/visualRegressionConf.js</a></li>
</ul>

<b>Bugfix</b>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed the problem that the Find unused screenshot action in the tool window produced false positive results when
        screenshots with the same name were present under multiple spec files.</li>
    <li>Fixed the problem that collecting screenshots happened by name and not by name and spec file.
        This returned false positive results during reference and gutter icon creation, and the missing screenshot inspection.</li>
</ul>
