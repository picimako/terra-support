<b>Bugfix</b>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed the problem when double-clicking on a screenshot node in the Terra Wdio tool window
        that had no latest version of that screenshot present, it resulted in an
        <code>IndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed the problem that hitting enter in the screenshot rename dialog also opened the editor for the selected
        screenshot.
