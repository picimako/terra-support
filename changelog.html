<h4>0.5.0</h4>
<b>New</b>
<ul>
    <li>A new <b>Navigate to Screenshot Usage</b> action is added to the Project View context menu for Terra screenshots,
        so that navigation to code can happen from there as well, besides the tool window.</li>
    <li>
        Added a couple of settings options:
        <ul>
            <li>project statistics can now be toggled in the Terra wdio tool window by a dedicated toolbar action</li>
            <li>screenshot line markers can now be enabled/disabled under <code> Editor > General > Gutter Icons</code></li>
            <li>wdio test root paths can be customized under <code>Settings > Tools > Terra Support</code></li>
            <li>an option to enabled/disable the confirmation dialog when deleting a screenshot via the tool window</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added Inlay Hints for Terra screenshot validation calls, to show the referenced screenshot names, and if a CSS selector
        is not explicitly specified, then show the global selector defined in <code>wdio.conf.js</code>.</li>
</ul>

<b>Bugfix</b>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue in <code>TerraDescribeViewportsBlockingInspection</code> that reported false positive results when the viewports argument
        in <code>Terra.describeViewports</code> blocks were referenced variables, function calls, etc. instead of a string literal.</li>
</ul>

<b>Maintenance</b>
<ul>
    <li>Optimized the project's unit test area, also making the project size much smaller.</li>
</ul>
