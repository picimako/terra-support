This inspection reports when there are multiple <code>Terra.describeViewports</code> blocks in a wdio spec file,
with the same set of viewport values, in which case they can probably be merged and handled together under the same
<code>Terra.describeViewports</code> blocks. Having the same set of values means their order doesn't have to match.
<p>
    This inspection only takes into account files where the number of such blocks are two or more than two.
<p>
    It reports all occurrences of duplicate describeViewports blocks.
