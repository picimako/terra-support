<b>Empty viewports / no viewports specified:
</b>
<p>
    This inspection reports problems when the viewports array has no viewport defined, or all the viewports are blank,
    as in either empty, or contain only whitespaces.

    You need to define either one or more viewports to have the test cases run properly, or remove the
    <code>Terra.describeViewports</code> block to run the tests on a single default viewport.
</p>
<b>Not supported viewports:
</b>
<p>
    Terra has support for six distinct viewports/breakpoints. In ascending order by their widths, they are: tiny, small,
    medium, large, huge, enormous.
    You can find more details about them in <a
        href="https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/components/terra-breakpoints/breakpoints/about#breakpoints">Cerner's
    Terra Breakpoints documentation</a>.
</p>
<b>Viewports defined as a non-array-type argument:
</b>
<p>
    The viewports argument of <code>Terra.describeViewports</code> accepts an array only, so any other type of value will be
    reported by this check. Though there are some exceptions in which case it would unnecessarily complex to compute the
    returned values: function calls, variables that reference further variables or function calls, not initialized variables.
