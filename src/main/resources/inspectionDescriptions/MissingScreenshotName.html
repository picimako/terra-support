<p>This inspection reports cases when the screenshot name of Terra.validates calls are missing. That parameter
    is mandatory in terra-functional-testing.</p>
<p>See the <a
        href="https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/dev_tools/cerner-terra-toolkit-docs/terra-functional-testing/upgrade-guides/version-1-upgrade-guide#upgrading-tests">Terra
    Upgrade Guide</a> for details.</p>
<p>This is executed only when the project uses terra-functional-testing, not the legacy terra-toolkit.</p>
