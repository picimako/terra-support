This inspection reports cases when the screenshot name of Terra.validates calls are missing. That parameter
    is mandatory in terra-functional-testing.
<p>See the <a

    Upgrade Guide</a> for details.
<p>This is executed only when the project uses terra-functional-testing, not the legacy terra-toolkit.
