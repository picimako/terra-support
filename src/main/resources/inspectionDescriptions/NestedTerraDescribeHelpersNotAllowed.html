This inspection reports problems where the Terra.describeViewports are nested into other blocks and are not top-level
ones.
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit-boneyard/blob/main/docs/Wdio_Utility.md">Terra Webdriver.io
    Utility Developer's Guide</a>
    states that <i>Terra.describeViewports blocks should not be nested and if tests need to run against different
        viewports then they should have their own top level Terra.describeViewports block.</i>
