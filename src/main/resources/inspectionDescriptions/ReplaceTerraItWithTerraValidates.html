<p>This inspection reports usage of <code>Terra.it</code> helpers, and provides quick fixes to replace them with their
    <code>Terra.validates></code> counterparts.
<p>
    All three Terra.it helpers are supported, and based on the presence of before hooks, alternative quick fixes may be
    available to merge the particular Terra.it with the <code>before</code> hook before it.
<p>
    For specific examples, please head to the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/picimako/terra-support/blob/master/docs/terra_helpers.md).
