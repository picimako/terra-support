<p>Reports problems where CSS selectors specified in <code>Terra.validates</code> and <code>Terra.it</code> calls match
    the global selector defined in the project's <code>wdio.conf.js</code> located in the project root directory.
</p>
<p>
    If they match, the selector property can be removed from the Terra calls, so that it can fall back to the global
    selector value.
