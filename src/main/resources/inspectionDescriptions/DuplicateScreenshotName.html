<p>This inspection reports cases when there is more than one validation referencing the same screenshot name.</p>
<p>In terra-functional-testing that is not allowed, and the test execution <i>"will throw a mismatch error because two
    screenshots are being generated with the same name"</i>.</p>
<p>See the <a
        href="https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/dev_tools/cerner-terra-toolkit-docs/terra-functional-testing/upgrade-guides/version-1-upgrade-guide#upgrading-tests">Terra
    Upgrade Guide</a> for details.</p>
<p>This is executed only when the project uses terra-functional-testing, not the legacy terra-toolkit.</p>
