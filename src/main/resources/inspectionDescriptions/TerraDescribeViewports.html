<b>
    Duplicate viewports:
</b>
<p>
    Duplicate viewports is not an incorrect construct and in itself won't result in test execution failure,
    but having duplicate viewports means that the test cases will be executed multiple times for that/those viewports
</p>
<b>
    Viewports not in ascending order:
</b>
<p>
    Although the order of viewports defined in the Terra.describeViewports block doesn't affect the test execution negatively,
    having them specified in ascending order by their width ensures that test implementations are consistent, it is easily
    readable what viewports are actually covered.
