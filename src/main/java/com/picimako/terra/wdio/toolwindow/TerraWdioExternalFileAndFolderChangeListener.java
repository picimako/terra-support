/**
 * Terra wdio specific implementation of {@link BulkFileListener}.
 * <p>
 * It listens to file system events of the current project, and handles file events, and in case a particular event
 * is initiated outside the Terra wdio tool window (and its actions), then the tool window's tree model is rebuilt.
 * <p>
 * This distinction of which events are handled based on their requestors is necessary, because each action registered to
 * the tool window handles these actions and the UI refresh by themselves, and doesn't have to rely on file system event listening.
 * <p>
 * Also, rebuilding the tree model is tied to precondition that the event should have happened within the test wdio folders.
 * <p>
 * See <a href="https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/virtual_file_system.html">Intellij Dev Guide: Virtual File System</a>
 * for virtual file system related information.
 * <p>
 * See {@link TerraWdioScreenshotsPanel#TerraWdioScreenshotsPanel(Project)} for subscribing to the related topic.
 * <p>
 * TODO:
 * <b>Possible improvement options:</b>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Update the tree only when the tool window is open.</li>
 *     <li>Additionally, update the tree only when the tool window is being opened. This of course needs handling of what if the tool
 *      window doesn't get closed. In that case it may need to be closed and opened manually, which is not ideal.</li>
 * </ul>
