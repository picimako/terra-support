/**
 * Provides a Swing component for displaying Terra wdio reference/latest images.
 * <p>
 * The returned component is an {@link ImageEditorImpl} displaying its original toolbar as well.
 * <p>
 * If there are both a reference and a latest image present in the provided {@link ScreenshotDiff}, then each of them
 * are are displayed in a reference/latest split view, which can also be resized by sliding the middle separator to the
 * left/right, but its position is not saved.
 * <p>
 * If, for some reason, there is no latest image provided (meaning that it was probably removed manually), then this
 * screenshot diff will not be included in the related preview, since showing only the reference image doesn't seem to
 * be helpful in test failure investigation.
